## Day 1

### What we did

The main theme is "bubble", so we think about a game in platform

But, them we walked through the scope to beat an high score and take the bubble to the maximun possible distance.
Basically, the buble starts and walk right the screen and beyond.

We decided to use Godot 4 with C# and have done a brainstorming with a bunch of good and bad ideas.

### To Do

- [ ] Think about the possible scenarios
- [ ] What are the possible external factors that can affect the bubble?
