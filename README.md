## Day 1

### What we did

The main theme is "bubble", so we think about a platform game.

But, we walked through the scope to beat an high score and take the bubble to the maximun possible distance.
This type of game is similar to the mobile game Jetpack Joyride.

Basically, the bubble starts and walk right the screen and beyond.
The player can control other objects in the scenario to affect the bubble, allowing it to go more far in the game.
Therefore, some interations will apply a penalty to the bubble making it to go slow or to consume more its "energy bar"

When the bubble's bar depletes, the game ends and go back to the start screen.

We decided to use Godot 4 with C# and have done a brainstorming with a bunch of good and bad ideas.

### To Do

- [ ] Think about the possible scenarios
- [ ] What are the possible external factors that can affect the bubble?
